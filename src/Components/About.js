    <h1>About Irrygate App</h1>
       <div className='about-box'>This app will have the functionality of starting a motor based on a click from me but itâ€™s more than that. We have developed an app that only starts the motor but can actually study all the environment variables store them into a database, while displaying them into the app.

Our goal is to generate Machine learning models from that data and generate a irrigation pattern from that data. To fix the Saffron decline that has occurred in the last few years.

With our data, people can cultivate Saffron in their own mini controlled environments.
Our device will come at small cost compared to the market.

With our device researches will not have to visit the field every day to take readings, the readings will be accessible to them in one click on their mobile phones.</div>
